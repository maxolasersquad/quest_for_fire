    <h2><i>Chapter 3</i> In the Cave</h2>
    <p>It was around the third part of the night. A moon as white as the flower of a bindweed traced along a cloud. Its light flowed over the river, over the taciturn rocks, one by one dissolving the shadows of the watering hole. The mammoths had moved on; only occasionally could one spot a creeping creature or some owl on its silent wings. And Gaw, whose turn it was to keep watch, was vigilant at the entrance of the cave. He was tired; his thoughts, scarce and fleeting, stirred only at sudden noises, intensified or new smells, at the fall or jerk of the wind. He existed in a stupor in which everything grew numb, except for the sense of danger and necessity. The sudden flight of a saiga made him lift his head. Then he caught sight of, on the other side of the river, on the steep hilltop, a massive silhouette swaying as it walked. The heavy yet supple limbs, the solid head, pointed at the jaws, some bizarre human-like appearance, indicated a bear. Gaw was familiar with the cave bear, a colossus with a domed forehead who lived peacefully in his lairs and pasturelands, a herbivore that only famine would drive to feed on flesh. The one that was approaching did not seem of this kind. Gaw was certain of this when it silhouetted in the moonlight: a flat skull, with a grayish coat, it had an air in which the Oulhamr recognized the confidence, the threat, and the ferocity of carnivorous beasts; it was the grey bear, rival of the great felines.</p>
    <p>Gaw remembered the legends reported by those who had traveled to the highlands. The gray bear can knock down an aurochs or an urus and carry them off more easily than a leopard can carry an antelope. Its claws can open a man's chest and belly with a single blow; it can suffocate a horse between its paws; it dares to challenge the tiger and the tawny lion; the old Goûn believes it only yields to the giant lion, the mammoth, the rhinoceros.</p>
    <p>The son of Saïga did not feel the sudden fear he would have felt in front of a tiger. Having met a cave bear, he had found it nonchalant and benevolent. This memory initially reassured him; however, the beast's demeanor appeared more equivocal as its silhouette became clearer, to the point that Gaw turned to the leader.</p>
    <p>He only had to touch his hand; the tall figure rose from the shadows:</p>
    <p>"What does Gaw want?" Naoh said, emerging at the entrance of the cave.</p>
    <p>The young nomad extended his hand towards the top of the hill; the leader's face darkened:</p>
    <p>"The Gray Bear!"</p>
    <p>His gaze examined the cave. He had taken care to gather stones and branches; a few boulders were nearby, which could make the entrance very difficult.</p>
    <p>But Naoh was considering fleeing, and retreat was only possible towards the watering hole. If the fast, tireless, and stubborn animal decided to give chase, it would almost certainly reach the fugitives. The only recourse would be to climb a tree: the gray bear did not climb. On the other hand, it was capable of waiting indefinitely, and there were only trees with thin branches nearby.</p>
    <p>Had the beast seen Gaw, crouched down, blending in with the boulders, careful to make no unnecessary movement? Or was it the inhabitant of the cave, returned after a long journey? As Naoh pondered these things, the animal began to descend the steep slope. When it reached less difficult terrain, it lifted its head, sniffed the moist atmosphere, and broke into a trot. For a moment, the two warriors thought it was moving away. But it stopped in front of the place where the ledge was accessible: retreat became impractical. Upstream, the ledge ended, the rock was sheer; downstream, one would have to flee under the eyes of the bear: it would have time to cross the narrow river and block the path of the fugitives. There was no choice but to wait, either for the departure of the beast or for the attack on the cave.</p>
    <p>Naoh woke Nam, and all three began to roll boulders.</p>
    <p>After some hesitation, the bear decided to cross the river. It arrived calmly and climbed onto the ledge. As it drew closer, its muscular structure became clearer; sometimes its teeth sparkled in the moonlight. Nam and Gaw shivered. The love of life swelled their hearts; the instinct of human weakness weighed on their breath; their youth pulsated as it does in the fearful chest of birds. Even Naoh was not calm. He knew the adversary; he knew that it would not take long for it to kill three men. And its thick skin, its granite bones were almost invulnerable to the spear, the axe, and the spike.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the nomads finished stacking the boulders; soon there was only an opening to the right, at man's height. When the bear was close, it shook its rumbling head and looked, puzzled. For although it had smelled the men, heard the noise of their work, it did not expect to see the den where it had spent so many seasons closed. A vague association formed in its skull between the closure of the den and those who occupied it. Moreover, recognizing the smell of weak animals it intended to feed on, it showed no caution. But it was perplexed.</p>
    <p>He stretched out in the moonlight, quite comfortable in his fur, displaying his silver chest and swaying his conical snout. Then he grew irritated, without reason, because his mood was gloomy, brutal, almost foreign to joy, and let out harsh roars. Then, growing impatient, he rose to his hind legs; he looked like a huge, hairy man, with legs too short and a torso too large. And he leaned towards the opening that remained.</p>
    <p>Nam and Gaw, in the dim light, held their axes ready; the son of the Leopard held his club aloft: they expected the beast to reach out its paws, which would allow them to cut them.</p>
    <p>It was the huge skull that came forward, the felted forehead, the drooling lips and the harpoon-point teeth. The axes fell, the club whirled, impotent due to the protrusions of the opening; the bear growled and backed off. He wasn't hurt: no traces of blood reddened his mouth; the motion of his jaws, the phosphorescence of his eyes, announced the indignation of the offended force.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, he did not disdain the lesson; he changed his tactics. An animal digger, endowed with a refined sense of obstacles, he knew that it is sometimes better to knock them down than to face a dangerous pass. He felt the wall, he pushed it: it vibrated under the pressure.</p>
    <p>The beast, increasing its effort, working with its paws, shoulder, and skull, sometimes charged at the barrier, sometimes pulled it with its shining claws. It made a dent, and finding a weak spot, it made it wobble. From then on, it focused on the same spot, all the more advantageous because the men's arms were too short to reach it. Moreover, they did not linger over useless efforts: Naoh and Gaw, bracing themselves in front of the bear, managed to stop the oscillation, while Nam leaned out of the opening and watched the beast's eye, where he planned to launch an arrow. Soon the attacker realized that the weak point had become unshakeable. This incomprehensible change, which denied his long experience, stunned and infuriated him. He stopped, sitting on his hindquarters; he observed the wall; he sniffed it; and he shook his head with an air of disbelief. Finally, he thought he had been mistaken; he returned to the obstacle, gave a swipe of his paw, a shoulder bump, and finding that the resistance persisted, he lost all caution and gave in to the brutality of his nature.</p>
    <p>The open space hypnotized him; it seemed to be the only passable route; he threw himself into it desperately. An arrow whistled and hit him near the eyelid, without slowing the attack, which was irresistible.</p>
    <p>The entire impetuous machine, the mass of flesh where the blood rolled in torrents, gathered its energies: the wall collapsed.</p>
    <p>Naoh and Gaw had leaped towards the back of the cave; Nam found himself in the monster's paws. He hardly thought about defending himself; he was like the antelope struck by the great panther, the horse brought down by the lion: arms outstretched, mouth wide open, he awaited death, in a state of numbness. But Naoh, initially surprised, regained the combative ardor that creates leaders and sustains the species. Just as Nam forgot himself in resignation, he forgot himself in the fight. He discarded his axe, which he deemed useless; he took the knotted oak club in both hands.</p>
    <p>The beast saw him coming. It delayed crushing the weak prey quivering beneath it; it raised its strength against the adversary, paws and claws projected like lightning, while the Oulhamr lowered his club. The weapon arrived first. It rolled on the bear's jaw; one of the points hit the nostrils. The blow, struck obliquely and ineffectively, was so painful that the brute bent. The nomad's second blow bounced off an indestructible skull.</p>
    <p>Already the immense beast was regaining its senses and charging frantically, but the Oulhamr had taken refuge in the shadows, in front of a protrusion in the rock: at the crucial moment, he disappeared; the bear violently hit the basalt. As it stumbled, Naoh returned obliquely and, with a war cry, brought down the club on the long vertebrae. They cracked; the beast, weakened by the collision with the outcrop, wobbled on its base and Naoh, drunk with energy, successively crushed the nostrils, the paws, the jaws, while Nam and Gaw opened the belly with axe blows.</p>
    <p>When finally the mass stopped panting, the nomads looked at each other in silence. It was an extraordinary minute. Naoh appeared to be the most formidable of the Oulhamr and of all men, for neither Faouhm nor Hoo, son of the Tiger, nor any of the mysterious warriors whose memory Goûn-aux-Os-Secs recalled had brought down a gray bear with club blows. And the legend was etched in the young men's skulls to be passed on to generations and to increase their hopes, if Nam, Gaw, and Naoh did not perish in the conquest of Fire.</p>
