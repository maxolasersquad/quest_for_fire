    <h2><i>Chapter 4</i> The Giant Lion and the Tigress</h2>
    <p>A moon had passed. For a long time, Naoh, ever moving southward, had crossed the savannah; he was traversing the forest. It seemed endless, broken up by islands of grass and stones, lakes, ponds, and hollows. It descended slowly, with unexpected rises, so that it produced all kinds of plants, all varieties of beasts. One could encounter the tiger, the yellow lion, the leopard, the Tree-Man, who lived alone with a few females, and whose strength surpassed that of ordinary men, the hyena, the boar, the wolf, the deer, the elk, the roe deer, the mouflon. The rhinoceros dragged its heavy armor there; perhaps even the giant lion, now extremely rare, its extinction having begun hundreds of centuries ago.</p>
    <p>The mammoth was also found there, ravager of the forest, crusher of branches and uprooter of trees, its passage more fierce than flood and cyclone. On this formidable territory, the nomads discovered abundant food; they themselves knew they were prey for the flesh-eaters. They walked with caution, in a triangle, to command the largest space possible. Their precise senses could protect them from ambushes during the day. Moreover, their deadliest enemies hardly hunted except in darkness. During the day, they did not have as quick a gaze as men; and their sense of smell was not comparable to that of wolves. These would have been the hardest to track: but, in the well-stocked forest, they hardly thought of hunting animals as threatening as the Oulhamr. Among the bears, the most powerful, the colossus of the caves, did not hunt, unless tormented by hunger. Herbivorous, it found in the soil enough to peacefully satiate its voracity. And the gray bear, who only roamed accidentally outside the cool regions, could be detected from a distance.</p>
    <p>However, the days were full of alerts and the nights terrifying. The Oulhamr carefully chose their places of refuge; they stopped long before dusk. Often they sought refuge in a hollow; at other times they connected blocks or, sheltering in a deep thicket, they sowed obstacles in their path; some evenings they chose a few closely spaced trees, where they fortified themselves.</p>
    <p>More than anything, the absence of Fire caused them suffering. On moonless nights, it seemed they were entering into the darkness forever; it weighed on their flesh, it swallowed them up.</p>
    <p>Every evening, they watched the grove, as if they were going to see the flame sparkle in its cage and grow by devouring the dead branches: they discerned only the lost sparks of stars or the eyes of a beast; their weakness overwhelmed them as did the cruel immensity. Perhaps they would have suffered less in the horde, with the crowd throbbing around them; in the endless solitude, their chests seemed shrunken.</p>
    <p>The forest opened. While the land of trees continued to fill the west, a plain spread to the east, part savannah and part bush, with a few islands of trees. The grass defended its expanse against the large plants, aided by the urus, the aurochs, the deer, the saigas, the hemiones, and the horses, which grazed on the young shoots. Enveloped by black poplars, ashy willows, aspens, alders, rushes, and reeds, a river flowed to the east. Some erratic stones bulged into reddish masses; and although it was still broad daylight, the long shadows dominated the rays of the sun. The nomads regarded the terrain with suspicion: many beasts must pass through it at the hour when light ends. So they hurried to drink. Then they explored the site. Most of the erratic stones, being solitary, could not be used; some, in groups, would have required a long work of fortification. And they were becoming disheartened, ready to return to the forest, when Nam noticed huge blocks, very close together, two of which touched at their summits, and which limited a cavity with four openings. The first three allowed access to beasts smaller than man - wolves, dogs, panthers. The fourth could give way to a large-statured warrior, provided he lay flat against the ground; it must be impracticable for the large bears, lions, and tigers.</p>
    <p>At the sign from their companion, Naoh and Gaw ran over. They feared at first that the chief might not be able to slip into the refuge. But Naoh, lying down on the grass and turning his head, entered without effort; he came out in the same way. So they found themselves with a shelter safer than any that had received them before, because the blocks were so heavy and so hard embedded that a herd of mammoths could not have dislodged them. There was no lack of space: ten men could have easily fit there.</p>
    <p>The prospect of a perfect night pleased the nomads. For the first time since their departure, they could mock all carnivores. They ate the raw meat of a fawn, with nuts picked in the forest, then they resumed surveying the territory. Some elks, some deer darted towards the water; crows rose with a war cry; an eagle soared at the height of the clouds. Then a lynx sprang in pursuit of a teal, a leopard stealthily crawled among the willows.</p>
    <p>The shadow was still lengthening. It soon covered the savannah; the sun was falling behind the trees, like an immense circular brazier, and the time was near when carnivorous life would dominate the solitudes. Nothing announced it yet. There was an innocent noise of sparrows; solitary or in flocks, they launched their rapid hymn towards the sun, a hymn of regret and fear, a hymn of the great sinister night.</p>
    <p>That's when an urus emerged from the forest. Where did it come from? What adventure had isolated it? Had it lingered or, on the contrary, having walked too fast, threatened by enemies or meteors, had it fled randomly? The nomads didn't ask themselves this; the passion for prey seized them, for if the hunters of their tribe hardly attacked the herds of large herbivores, they watched for solitary beasts, especially the weak and wounded. The bravery and tenacity of the urus are found in some of our bull breeds, but the urus had a less obscure head. The species was at its peak. Nimble, with a lively breath, a clear sense of peril and complex cunning, these strong organisms circulated magnificently on the planet.</p>
    <p>Naoh rose with a growl. After victory over a beast, nothing was more glorious than to bring down a large herbivore. The Oulhamr felt in his heart this instinct by which everything necessary for the growth of man is maintained; his ardor increased as the spacious chest and gleaming horns approached. But he was subject to another instinct: not to destroy in vain the nourishing flesh. Now he had fresh meat; prey was abundant. Finally, remembering his triumph over the bear, Naoh judged it less meritorious to bring down an urus. He lowered his spear, he renounced a hunt where he could damage his weapons. And the urus, advancing slowly, took the path to the river.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, the three men raised their heads, their senses dilated by peril. Their doubt was short: Nam and Gaw, at a sign from the chief, slipped under the erratic blocks. He himself was following them, just as a megaloceros burst out of the forest.</p>
    <p>The whole beast was a vertigo of flight. The head with vast palmations thrown back, a foam mixed with scarlet streaming from the nostrils, the legs bouncing like branches in a cyclone, the megaloceros had made about thirty leaps, when the enemy emerged in turn. It was a tiger, with stocky limbs, elastic vertebrae, and whose body, at each recovery, crossed twenty cubits. Its flexible leaps seemed like slides in the atmosphere. Every time the feline reached the ground, there was a brief pause, a reconcentration of energy.</p>
    <p>In its less wide-ranging movement, the cervid didn't undergo any halt. Each jump was an accelerated continuation of the previous one. At this stage of the pursuit, it was losing ground.</p>
    <p>For the tiger, the race had just begun, while the megaloceros had come from afar.</p>
    <p>"The tiger will seize the great deer!" Nam said in a trembling voice.</p>
    <p>Naoh, who was passionately watching this hunt, replied:</p>
    <p>"The great deer is tireless."</p>
    <p>Not far from the river, the megaloceros' lead was reduced by half. In a supreme tension, it increased its speed; the two bodies propelled themselves with equal rapidity, then the tiger's leaps narrowed. It would undoubtedly have given up the pursuit, had the river not been close; it hoped to regain ground by swimming: its long undulating body excelled at it. When it reached the bank, the megaloceros was fifty cubits away. The tiger slipped through the wave with extraordinary velocity; but the megaloceros progressed only slightly slower. It was the moment of life and death.</p>
    <p>As the river was not wide, the cervid was due to land with a lead: if it hesitated while hoisting itself onto the bank, it would be caught. It knew this; it had even risked a detour to choose the landing spot: it was a small rocky promontory, with a gentle slope. Although the megaloceros had calculated its exit accurately, it hesitated vaguely, during which the tiger drew closer. Finally, the herbivore lifted off. It was twenty cubits away when the tiger hit the ground and made its first leap. This leap was hasty, the feline tangled its legs, stumbled and rolled: the megaloceros had the upper hand. There was only to break off the pursuit; the tiger understood this and, remembering a tall silhouette glimpsed during the race, it hurried to cross the river again. The urus was still in sight...</p>
    <p>At the passage of the hunt, it had retreated towards the forest. Then it showed a growing uncertainty as the great feline moved away and especially when it disappeared among the reeds. The urus was still deciding to retreat, but a formidable smell struck its nostrils. It stretched its neck and, convinced, sought a line of flight. Thus, it arrived not far from the erratic blocks where the Oulhamr lodged: the human effluvium reminded it of an attack where, young and frail still, it had been wounded by a projectile, so it deviated again.</p>
    <p>It was now trotting; it was about to disappear into the thicket, when it suddenly stopped: the tiger was coming at a great pace. It was not afraid that the urus, like the megaloceros, would escape it in the race, but its disappointment was making it impatient. At the sight of the beast, the bull made up its mind. Knowing it couldn't rely on speed, it faced the danger. Head low, digging the earth, it was, with its wide russet chest, its eyes of purple fire, a fine warrior of the forest and the prairie; a dark rage swept away its fears; the blood pounding in its heart was the blood of battle; the instinct of preservation transformed into courage.</p>
    <p>The tiger recognized the worth of the adversary. It didn't attack abruptly; it zigzagged, with the crawl of a reptile; it waited for the hasty or clumsy gesture that would allow it to mount the flank, to break the vertebrae or the jugular.</p>
    <p>But the urus, attentive to the aggressor's maneuvers, always presented its compact forehead and sharp horns...</p>
    <p>Suddenly, the carnivore stood still. With stiff legs, its large yellow eyes fixed, almost dazed, it watched a monstrous beast advance. It resembled the tiger, with a taller and more compact stature; it also recalled the lion, with its mane, its deep chest, its grave gait.</p>
    <p>Although it arrived incessantly, with a sense of its supremacy, it displayed the hesitation of the animal that is not on its hunting ground. The tiger was at home! For ten seasons, it had held the territory, and other beasts, leopard, panther, hyena, lived in its shadow; every prey was its own as soon as it had chosen it; no creature stood before it when, at the chance encounters, it slaughtered the elk, the deer, the megaloceros, the urus, the aurochs, or the antelope. The gray bear might have, in the cold season, passed through his domain, other tigers lived in the north and lions in the river lands: none had come to challenge its power. And it had only made way for the invulnerable rhinoceros or the mammoth with massive feet, considering the task of fighting them too tough. But it did not recognize the strange form that had just appeared, and its senses were astonished.</p>
    <p>It was a very rare beast, a beast of ancient ages, whose species had been declining for millennia. By all its instinct, the tiger perceived that it was stronger, better armed, as fast as itself, but, by all its habit, by its long victory, it rebelled against fear. Its gesture expressed this dual tendency. As the enemy approached, it sidestepped rather than retreated; its attitude remained threatening. When the distance was sufficiently reduced, the lion-tiger inflated its vast chest and growled, then, crouching low, it made its first leap of attack, a leap of twenty-five cubits. The tiger retreated. At the second leap of the colossus, it turned to retreat.</p>
    <p>This movement was only sketched. Rage brought it back, its yellow eyes turned green; it accepted the fight.</p>
    <p>For it was no longer alone.</p>
    <p>A tigress had just sprung up on the grass; she was rushing, brilliant, impetuous and magnificent, to the aid of her male.</p>
    <p>The giant lion hesitated in turn, doubting its strength. Perhaps it would have withdrawn then, leaving the tigers their territory, if the adversary, overexcited by the yowling of the approaching tigress, hadn't made a move to take the offensive. The enormous feline could resign itself to yielding the place, but its terrible musculature, the memory of all the flesh it had torn and limbs it had crushed, forced it to punish the aggression. Only one leap separated it from the tiger. It made it, without yet reaching the goal, for the other had swerved and attempted a flank attack. The cave lion stopped to receive the assault. Claws and muzzles entwined; the clashing of the devouring teeth and the harsh breaths could be heard. Lower on its legs, the tiger tried to seize the enemy's throat; it was close to succeeding.</p>
    <p>Precise movements repelled it; it found itself toppled under a sovereign paw, and the giant lion began to open its belly. The entrails spurted out in blue cords, the blood flowed, scarlet, among the grasses, a dreadful outcry made the savannah tremble. And the lion-tiger began to crack the ribs when the tigress arrived. Hesitant, she sniffed the warm flesh, the defeat of her male; she let out a call.</p>
    <p>At this cry, the tiger rose, a supreme warlike wave swept through its skull, but at the first step, its trailing guts stopped it, and it remained motionless, its limbs failing, its eyes still full of life. The tigress measured by instinct what energy remained to the one who had for so long shared with her the throbbing prey, watched over the generations, defended the Species against countless snares. An obscure tenderness shook her rough nerves; she felt, in block, the community of their struggles, their joys, their sufferings. Then the law of nature softened her; she knew that a force more terrible than that of the tigers stood before her and, trembling with the need to live, with a muted complaint, a long look back, she fled towards the grove.</p>
    <p>The giant lion did not follow her; he relished the supremacy of his muscles, he breathed in the evening atmosphere, the atmosphere of adventure, love, and prey. The tiger no longer troubled him; he watched it, however; he hesitated to finish it off, for he had a cautious soul and, victorious, feared unnecessary injuries...</p>
    <p>The red hour had come; it flowed through the depth of the forests, slow, variable, and insidious. The diurnal beasts fell silent.</p>
    <p>At intervals, the howling of wolves, the barking of dogs, the sarcastic laughter of the hyena, the sigh of a bird of prey, the splashing call of frogs, or the screech of a late locust could be heard. While the sun died behind an ocean of peaks, the immense moon rose over the east.</p>
    <p>No other beasts were in sight other than the two predators: the aurochs had disappeared during the struggle; in the half-light, a thousand subtle nostrils were aware of the formidable presences. The giant lion once again felt the weakness of its strength. Countless prey pulsed deep in the thickets and clearings, yet, each day, it had to fear famine. For it carried its atmosphere with it: it betrayed it more surely than its gait, the crackling of the earth, grasses, leaves, and branches. It spread out, acrid and fierce; it was palpable in the darkness and even on the surface of the waters, it was the terror and the safeguard of the weak. Then, everything fled, hid, vanished. The earth became deserted; there was no more life; there was no more prey; the feline seemed alone in the world.</p>
    <p>Now, in the approaching night, the colossus was hungry. Driven from its territory by a cataclysm, it had crossed rivers and the river, prowled by unknown horizons. And now, a new area conquered by the defeat of the tiger, it sniffed, it searched in the breeze for the scent of scattered flesh.</p>
    <p>All prey seemed distant to it; it barely perceived the rustle of the little creatures hidden by the grass, a few nests of sparrows, two herons perched at the fork of a black poplar, whose vigilance would not have been surprised, even if the feline could have climbed the tree; but, since it had reached its full stature, it climbed only on low trunks and among thick branches.</p>
    <p>Hunger made it turn towards that warm wave that flowed with the entrails of the vanquished; it approached it, it sniffed it: it repulsed it like a venom. Impatient, it leapt on the tiger, crushed its vertebrae, then began to roam.</p>
    <p>The profile of the erratic stones attracted it. As they were upwind and its sense of smell was not as keen as that of the wolves, it had ignored the presence of men. When it approached, it knew that the prey was there and hope quickened its breath.</p>
    <p>The Oulhamr watched with a thrill the tall silhouette of the carnivore. Since the flight of the megaloceros, all the sinister legend, all that makes the living tremble had passed before their eyes. In the red decline, they saw the lion-tiger circling around the refuge; its snout dug into the crevices; its eyes darted green starry glimmers; its whole being exuded haste and hunger. When it arrived in front of the opening where the men had slipped through, it lowered itself; it attempted to insert its head and shoulders; and the nomads doubted the stability of the blocks. With each undulation of the great body, Nam and Gaw curled up, with a sigh of distress. Hatred animated Naoh, hatred of the coveted flesh, hatred of the new intelligence against the ancient instinct and its excessive power. It grew when the brute began to scratch the earth. Though the giant lion was not a burrowing animal, it knew how to widen an exit or topple an obstacle. Its attempt dismayed the men, so much so that Naoh crouched down and struck with the spear: the beast, hit in the head, let out a furious growl and stopped digging. Its phosphorescent eyes explored the semi-darkness; being nyctalopic, it distinctly distinguished the three silhouettes, all the more irritating for being so close.</p>
    <p>It resumed prowling, testing the exits; it always returned to the one through which the men had entered. Eventually, it began to dig again: another spear thrust interrupted its work and made it retreat, with less surprise than before.</p>
    <p>In its opaque head, it conceived that entrance to the den was impossible, but it did not give up on the prey, it kept the hope that, so close, it would not escape. After a final inhale and one last look, it seemed to ignore the existence of the men; it headed towards the forest.</p>
    <p>The three nomads were elated; the retreat seemed safer; they deliciously inhaled the night: it was one of those moments when the nerves are more delicate and the muscles more energetic; countless feelings, lifting their indecisive souls, evoked primal beauty; they loved life and its framework, they tasted something made of all things, a happiness created outside and above the immediate action. And, as they could neither communicate such an impression to each other nor even think of doing so, they turned their laughter towards each other, this contagious joy that only bursts on the faces of men. No doubt they expected to see the giant lion return, but, having no precise notion of time - which would have been fatal to them - they savored the present in its fullness: the duration separating the twilight of the evening from that of the morning seemed inexhaustible.</p>
    <p>As was his habit, Naoh had taken the first watch. He was not sleepy. Agitated by the battle of the tiger and the giant lion, he felt, when Gaw and Nam lay down, the notions that tradition and experience had accumulated in his skull stir. They connected in a confused way, forming the legend of the World. And already the world was vast in the intelligence of the Oulhamr. They knew the course of the sun and the moon, the cycle of darkness following light, light following darkness, the cold season alternating with the warm season; the path of rivers and streams; the birth, old age, and death of men; the shape, habits, and strength of countless beasts; the growth of trees and grass, the art of shaping the spear, axe, club, scraper, harpoon, and how to use them; the course of the wind and clouds; the whim of the rain and the ferocity of the lightning. Lastly, they knew Fire - the most terrible and gentlest of living things - strong enough to destroy an entire savanna and forest with their mammoths, rhinoceroses, lions, tigers, bears, aurochs, and urus.</p>
    <p>The life of Fire had always fascinated Naoh. Like the beasts, it needs prey: it feeds on branches, dry grass, fat; it grows; each Fire gives birth to other Fires; each Fire can die. But the stature of a Fire is unlimited, and, on the other hand, it can be endlessly cut; each piece can live. It decreases when deprived of food: it becomes as small as a bee, as a fly, and yet, it can be reborn along a blade of grass, become as vast as a marsh. It's a beast and it's not a beast. It has no legs or creeping body, and it outpaces the antelopes; no wings, and it flies in the clouds; no mouth, and it blows, it growls, it roars; no hands or claws, and it seizes the entire expanse... Naoh loved, hated, and feared it. As a child, he had sometimes suffered its bite; he knew that it has no preference for anyone - ready to devour those who maintain it - more treacherous than the hyena, more ferocious than the panther. But its presence is delightful; it dispels the cruelty of cold nights, provides rest from fatigue, and makes the weakness of men formidable.</p>
    <p>In the dim light of the basaltic stones, Naoh, with a gentle longing, saw the campfire's glow and the flickers that touched Gammla's face. The rising moon reminded him of the distant flame. From what place on earth does the moon spring forth, and why, like the sun, does it never go out? It diminishes; there are evenings when it is nothing more than a Fire as feeble as the one that runs along a twig. Then it revives. No doubt, Hidden Men take care of its upkeep and feed it according to the times... Tonight, it is in its full strength: initially as high as the trees, it diminishes, but shines more, as it ascends into the sky. The Hidden Men must have given it abundant dry wood.</p>
    <p>While the son of the Leopard dreams of these things, the nocturnal beasts go on their adventure. Furtive silhouettes glide across the grass. He discerns shrews, jerboas, agoutis, light weasels, reptile-bodied stoats; then comes a ten-pronged deer that streaks, against the moonlight, like a spear. Naoh observes its dry legs, its earth and oak-colored body, the antlers it inclines over its neck. It has disappeared. Wolves show their round heads, their thin mouths, their sharp and lively paws. The belly is pale, the flanks and back are russet, then a dark band outlines the vertebrae; strong muscles swell the nape, the entire demeanor reveals something sneaky, judicious, and complex, highlighted by the obliqueness of the gaze. They sniff the deer, but he himself, in the humidity of the shadows, has received notice of their approach and his lead is substantial. The intelligent nostrils discern the continuous decrease of scents: the wolves know that the herbivore is gaining ground. Yet, they cross the savannah, up to the cover where the fastest penetrate. The pursuit seems futile. All return at a slow pace, disappointed, some howl and whine. Then the nostrils resume exploring the atmosphere. They detect nothing nearby, except the carcass of the tiger and the men hidden among the stones: a prey too formidable and a flesh that, despite their gluttony, the wolves find repugnant.</p>
    <p>They approach it, however, after having circled the men's den.</p>
    <p>At first, the wolves prowled around the carcass, with that excessive caution that leaves nothing to chance. Finally, the impatient ones took a risk. They brought their muzzles close to the tiger's head, close to the large half-open muzzle, from which once blew a life both pestilent and formidable; exploring the body, they licked the red wounds. Yet, none decided to sink their teeth into this harsh flesh, full of poison, for which only the stomachs of the vulture and the hyena have enough vehemence.</p>
    <p>A clamor heightened their uncertainty – whimpers, howls, snickers. Six hyenas emerged in the moonlight.</p>
    <p>They advanced with an equivocal gait, with their robust forequarters, their torsos that lower and taper to end in slender legs. Bow-legged, the short muzzle capable of crushing the bones of lions, the triangular pupils, the pointed ear and the coarse mane, they twisted, veered, or hopped like locusts. The wolves felt the awful stench of their glands intensify.</p>
    <p>These were high-statured prowlers who, by the enormous strength of their jaws, would have stood up to the tigers. But they only faced them when cornered, which hardly happened, no prowler seeking their fetid flesh and the other scavengers being weaker than them. Although they knew their superiority over the wolves, they hesitated, they circled in the night light, approaching and retreating, inflating, at intervals, piercing clamors. In the end, they all attacked at once.</p>
    <p>The wolves did not attempt any resistance, but, confident of being the most agile, they stayed a short distance away. Because it escaped them, they regretted the despised prey. They prowled around the hyenas with sudden howls, with feints of attack, with mischievous gestures, pleased to disturb the enemies.</p>
    <p>They, dark and growling, attacked the carcass: they would have preferred it putrid, swarming, but their last meals had been poor, and the presence of the wolves excited their voracity! They first savored the entrails; crushing the ribs with their indestructible teeth, they extracted the heart, the lungs, the liver and the rough tongue, which agony had made protrude. It was still the pleasure of rebuilding the living flesh with the dead flesh, the sweetness of feasting instead of prowling with an empty stomach and a worried head. The wolves understood it well, they who chased in vain, since twilight, the emanations of air and ground.</p>
    <p>In their disappointed fury, several went to sniff the erratic blocks. One of them slipped his head through an opening; Naoh, with disdain, landed him a blow with a spear. Struck in the shoulder, the beast hopped on three legs, with a lamentable howl.</p>
    <p>Then, all clamored, in a brilliant and wild way, where the threat was a sham. Their russet bodies swayed in the moonlight, their eyes shone with the ardor and fear of living, their teeth cast foam glows, while their thin paws skimmed the ground, with a small shivering noise, or stiffened in anticipation: the desire to feast became unbearable. But, knowing that, behind the basalt, clever and sturdy beings were lurking, who would succumb only by surprise, they stopped their prowling. Clustered in a hunting council, they exchanged rumors and gestures, several sitting on their hindquarters, mouths waiting, some agitated, rubbing their spines together. The elders attracted attention, especially a large wolf with pale fur, ocher teeth: he was listened to, watched, sniffed with deference.</p>
    <p>Naoh did not doubt that they had a language: they understand each other to set up ambushes, surround the prey, take turns during pursuits, share the spoils. He regarded them with curiosity, as he would have regarded men; he tried to guess their project.</p>
    <p>A troop swam across the river; the others scattered under the cover. Nothing more was heard but the hyenas still focused on the tiger's carcass.</p>
    <p>The moon, less vast and brighter, languished the stars; the weakest remained invisible, the bright ones seemed poorly lit and as if drowned under a wave; an equivocal torpor covered the forest and the savannah. Sometimes a barn owl streaked the blue atmosphere, extraordinarily silent on its cottony wings, sometimes frogs clattered in groups, perched on the leaves of water lilies or hoisted on stumps; the noctuids, launching into trembling races, collided with some bats jolting through the shadows.</p>
    <p>Finally, howls echoed. They answered each other along the river and in the depths of the bushes; Naoh knew that the wolves had surrounded a prey. He didn't wait long to be sure. A beast sprang onto the plain. It looked like a horse with a narrow chest; a brown line underlined its spine. It darted forward, with the speed of the deer, followed by three wolves who, less nimble than it, could only rely on their endurance or an accident to catch it. Moreover, they did not give their full speed, they continued to respond to the howls of their hidden companions. Soon they emerged; the hemione found itself invested. It stopped, trembling on its hocks, exploring the horizon before making a decision. All exits were blocked, except to the north, where only an old gray wolf was seen.</p>
    <p>The hunted beast chose this path. The old wolf, impassive, let it come. When it was close and ready to bolt at an angle, he let out a deep howl. Then, on a mound, three other wolves showed themselves.</p>
    <p>The hemione stopped with a long whine. It felt death and pain all around it. The expanse was closed, where its agile body had foiled so many covetousness: its cunning, light feet, and strength were failing together. It turned its head several times towards these beings who live neither on herbs nor leaves, but on living flesh; it implored them obscurely.</p>
    <p>They, exchanging clamors, tightened the circle; their eyes darted thirty fires of murder: they panicked the prey, fearing its hard horn hooves; those in front mimicked attacks, so that it would stop watching its flanks... The closest were a few elbow lengths away. Then, in a start, resorting once more to its liberating legs, the defeated beast launched itself desperately to break the hold and overtake it. It knocked over the first wolf, made the second stumble: the intoxicating space was open before it. A new beast, appearing unexpectedly, leaped onto the flanks of the fugitive; others sank their sharp teeth into her. Desperately, it reared; a wolf, with its jaw broken, rolled among the grasses; but the hemione's throat opened, its flanks turned crimson, two hocks cracked under the impact of the canines; it collapsed under a cluster of jaws that were devouring it alive.</p>
    <p>For a while, Naoh contemplated this body from which breaths, complaints, and revolt against death still gushed. With growls of joy, the wolves snapped up the warm flesh and drank the hot blood; life incessantly entered the insatiable bellies. Sometimes, with anxiety, some old ones turned to the troop of hyenas: they would have preferred this prey, more tender and less poisonous, but they knew that timid beasts become brave to defend what they owe to their effort; they had not ignored the pursuit of the hemione and the victory of the wolves. They resigned themselves to the tough carcass of the tiger.</p>
    <p>The moon was halfway to the zenith. Having fallen asleep, Naoh left the watch to Gaw; one could vaguely make out the river flowing in the vast silence. Then, disturbance returned; the forests roared, the bushes crackled, the wolves and hyenas together lifted their bloody muzzles, and Gaw, advancing his head in the shadow of the stones, sharpened his hearing, sight, and sense of smell... A cry of agony, a brief growl, then branches parted. The giant lion emerged from the forest, a deer in its jaws. Close to him, still humble yet already familiar, the tigress slithered like a gigantic reptile.</p>
    <p>Both of them advanced towards the humans' refuge.</p>
    <p>Seized with fear, Gaw touched Naoh's shoulder. The nomads watched the two beasts for a long time: the lion-tiger tore its prey with a continuous and broad movement, the tigress showed uncertainties, sudden fears, sidelong glances at the one who had overpowered her mate. And Naoh felt a great apprehension tightening his chest and slowing his breath.</p>
