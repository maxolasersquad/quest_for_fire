    <h2><i>Chapter 1</i> The Death of Fire</h2>
    <p>The Oulhamr were fleeing into the terrifying night. Driven mad by suffering and fatigue, everything seemed in vain before the ultimate calamity: the Fire had died. They had been carrying it in three cages since the dawn of their tribe; four women and two warriors fed it night and day.</p>
    <p>Even in the darkest of times, it received the sustenance it needed to live; sheltered from the rain, storms, and floods, it had crossed rivers and swamps, never ceasing to glow blue in the morning and bleed red at night. Its mighty face kept the black lion and the yellow lion, the cave bear and the grey bear, the mammoth, the tiger, and the leopard at bay; its red teeth protected man against the vast world. All joy dwelled near it.</p>
    <p>It brought forth a savory scent from the meats, hardened the tips of the spears, and caused the hard stone to burst; its warmth lent a gentle yet powerful comfort; it reassured the tribe in the trembling forests, on the endless savannah, in the depths of the caves. It was the Father, the Guardian, the Savior, yet fiercer, more dreadful than the mammoths when it fled the cage and devoured the trees.</p>
    <p>It was dead! The enemy had destroyed two cages; in the third, during the escape, they had seen it falter, grow pale and diminish. So weak, it could not bite the swamp grasses; it pulsed like a sick beast. At the end, it was a reddish insect, battered by every breath of wind…</p>
    <p>It had vanished… And the Oulhamr were fleeing, stripped bare, into the autumn night. There were no stars. The heavy sky touched the heavy waters; the plants reached out their cold fibers; one could hear the reptiles slapping against the water; men, women, and children were swallowed up, invisible. As much as they could, guided by the voices of their leaders, the Oulhamr followed a line of higher and harder ground, sometimes fording, sometimes on islets.</p>
    <p>Three generations had known this path, but it would have required the glow of the stars. Towards dawn, they approached the savannah.</p>
    <p>A chilled glow filtered through the clouds of chalk and shale. The wind swirled over waters as thick as tar; the algae swelled into pustules; the numbed saurians rolled amongst the water lilies and the arrowheads. A heron ascended from an ash tree, and the savannah appeared with its trembling plants under a russet haze, stretching into the horizon. The men rose, less exhausted, and stepping through the reeds, they found themselves in the grass, on solid ground.</p>
    <p>Then, as the deathly fever receded, many became inert creatures: they collapsed on the ground, they sank into rest. The women held up better than the men; those who had lost their children in the marsh wailed like wolves; all ominously felt the decline of the race and the burdensome days ahead; some, having saved their little ones, lifted them towards the clouds.</p>
    <p>In the new light, Faouhm took a tally of his tribe, using his fingers and twigs. Each twig represented the fingers of both hands. He counted poorly; he saw, however, that four twigs of warriors remained, over six twigs of women, about three twigs of children, and a few elders.</p>
    <p>And old Goûn, who counted better than anyone else, said that not one man in five, one woman in three, and one child in a twig remained. Then those who were awake felt the enormity of the disaster. They realized that their lineage was threatened at its source and that the forces of the world were becoming more formidable: they would roam, weak and naked, on the earth.</p>
    <p>Despite his strength, Faouhm despaired. He no longer trusted his stature or his enormous arms; his broad face where coarse hairs clustered, his eyes, yellow like those of leopards, displayed crushing weariness; he considered the wounds the enemy's lance and arrow had inflicted on him; he drank in intervals, from the crook of his arm, the blood still flowing.</p>
    <p>Like all the defeated, he dwelled on the moment he had almost won. The Oulhamr were rushing for the slaughter; he, Faouhm, crushed heads under his club. They were about to annihilate the men, take the women, kill the enemy Fire, hunt in new savannahs and in abundant forests. What wind had passed? Why had the Oulhamr spiraled in terror? Why were their bones that cracked, their bellies that spilled their guts, their chests that screamed in agony, while the enemy, invading the camp, toppled the Sacred Fires? So pondered the soul of Faouhm, dense and slow. It clung to this memory like a hyena to its carcass. It refused to be defeated, it didn't feel it had less energy, courage, or ferocity.</p>
    <p>The light rose in its strength. It rolled over the marsh, stirring the mud and drying the savannah. The joy of morning was in it, the fresh flesh of plants. The water seemed lighter, less treacherous, less murky. It swirled with silvery faces among the verdigris islands; it threw long shivers of malachite and pearls, it spread out pale sulfur, flakes of mica, and its scent was sweeter through the willows and the alders. Depending on the interplay of adaptations and circumstances, algae triumphed, the pond lily or the yellow water lily sparkled, water flambeaux, marsh euphorbias, loosestrifes, arrowheads emerged, expanses of buttercup with aconite leaves, meanders of hairy stonecrop, cotton-grasses, rose-colored willow-herbs, bitter cresses, sundews, jungles of reeds and osier beds teeming with water hens, black knights, teals, plovers, lapwings with jade reflections, the heavy bustard or the long-fingered crake. Herons watched on the edge of reddish creeks; cranes frolicked clattering on a promontory; the barbel pike lunged at the tenches, and the last dragonflies shot across in streaks of green fire, in zigzags of lazulite.</p>
    <p>Faouhm considered his tribe. Disaster clung to it like a brood of reptiles: yellow from silt, crimson from blood, green from algae, it exuded an odor of fever and rotten flesh.</p>
    <p>There were men curled upon themselves like pythons, others laid out like saurians, and some moaned, gripped by death. The wounds turned black, ghastly on the belly, even more so on the head, where they expanded through the reddened sponge of hair. Nearly all were likely to recover, those most injured having succumbed on the other shore or perished in the waters.</p>
    <p>Faouhm, shifting his gaze from the sleepers, examined those who felt the bitterness of defeat more sharply than exhaustion.</p>
    <p>Many testified to the impressive structure of the Oulhamr.</p>
    <p>They had heavy faces, low skulls, and violent jaws. Their skin was tawny, not black; almost all possessed hairy torsos and limbs. The subtlety of their senses extended to smell, which competed with that of beasts.</p>
    <p>They had large eyes, often fierce, sometimes bewildered, the beauty of which was particularly vivid in children and some young girls. Although their type brought them close to our lower races, any comparison would be illusory. The Paleolithic tribes lived in a profound atmosphere; their flesh concealed a youth that will never return, a flower of life whose energy and vehemence we can only imperfectly imagine.</p>
    <p>Faouhm lifted his arms to the sun, with a long howl: "What will the Oulhamr do without Fire?" he cried.</p>
    <p>"How will they live in the savannah and the forest? Who will defend them against the darkness and the winter wind? They will have to eat raw meat and bitter plant; they will no longer warm their limbs; the spearhead will remain soft. The lion, the beast-with-tearing-teeth, the bear, the tiger, the great hyena will devour them alive in the night. Who will regain the Fire? That person will be the brother of Faouhm; he will have three hunting shares, four shares of booty; he will receive in share Gammla, my sister's daughter, and if I die, he will take the command stick."</p>
    <p>Then Naoh, the Leopard's son, rose and said, "Give me two warriors with swift legs, and I will take the Fire from the Mammoth's sons or from the Man-Eaters, who hunt on the banks of the Double-River."</p>
    <p>Faouhm did not cast a favorable glance at him. Naoh was, in stature, the tallest of the Oulhamr. His shoulders were still growing. There was no warrior as agile, nor whose run was more enduring. He overpowered Moûh, son of the Urus, whose strength approached that of Faouhm. And Faouhm feared him. He assigned him repugnant tasks, kept him away from the tribe, exposed him to death.</p>
    <p>Naoh did not like the chief; but he was exalted at the sight of Gammla, reclining, flexible, and mysterious, her hair like foliage. Naoh watched her among the osiers, behind the trees, or in the folds of the earth, with warm skin and trembling hands. Depending on the hour, he was filled with tenderness or anger.</p>
    <p>Sometimes he would open his arms, to take her slowly and gently, sometimes he thought about pouncing on her, as one does with the daughters of enemy hordes, throwing her to the ground with a club strike. However, he didn't wish to harm her: if she had been his wife, he would have treated her without harshness, not liking to see fear growing on faces that makes them alien.</p>
    <p>In other times, Faouhm would have poorly received the words of Naoh. But he was weighed down by disaster. Perhaps an alliance with the Leopard's son would be good; otherwise, he would know how to put him to death. And, turning to the young man, "Faouhm has but one tongue. If you bring back the Fire, you will have Gammla, without giving any ransom in return. You will be Faouhm's son." He spoke with his hand raised, slowly, harshly, and contemptuously.</p>
    <p>Then he signaled Gammla.</p>
    <p>She stepped forward, trembling, lifting her changeable eyes, full of the moist fire of the clouds. She knew that Naoh watched her among the grasses and in the darkness: when he appeared at the turn of the grass, as if he was about to swoop down on her, she feared him; sometimes, too, his image was not unpleasant to her; she simultaneously wished that he would perish under the blows of the Man-Eaters and that he would bring back the Fire.</p>
    <p>Faouhm's rough hand fell on the girl's shoulder. He shouted, in his wild pride, "Who among the daughters of men is better built? She can carry a doe on her shoulder, walk without faltering from morning sun to evening sun, endure hunger and thirst, prepare the skin of beasts, swim across a lake; she will give indestructible children. If Naoh brings back the Fire, he will come and take her without giving axes, horns, shells or furs!..."</p>
    <p>Then Aghoo, son of the Aurochs, the hairiest of the Oulhamr, stepped forward, full of desire, "Aghoo wants to win the Fire. He will go with his brothers to watch the enemies beyond the river. And he will die by the axe, the spear, the tiger's tooth, the claw of the giant lion, or he will return the Fire to the Oulhamr without which they are as weak as deer or saigas."</p>
    <p>One could only see of his face a mouth rimmed with raw flesh and homicidal eyes. His squat stature exaggerated the length of his arms and the enormity of his shoulders; his entire being expressed a rough, tireless, and merciless power. It was unknown how far his strength went: he had not tested it against Faouhm, nor against Mouh, nor against Naoh. It was known to be enormous. He did not test it in any peaceful struggle: all those who had stood in his path had succumbed, whether he simply mutilated a limb or killed them and added their skulls to his trophies. He lived apart from the other Oulhamr, with his two brothers, hairy like him, and several women reduced to a horrifying servitude. Although the Oulhamr naturally practiced hardness towards themselves and ferocity towards others, they feared, in the sons of the Aurochs, an excess of these virtues. An obscure disapproval rose, the first alliance of the crowd against excessive insecurity.</p>
    <p>A group crowded around Naoh, who most accused of being too lax in seeking vengeance. But this fault, because it was found in a fearsome warrior, pleased those who had not been endowed with thick muscles or swift limbs.</p>
    <p>Faouhm no less detested Aghoo than the Leopard's son; he feared him more. The hairy and cunning strength of the brothers seemed invulnerable. If one of the three wanted a man's death, all three wanted it; whoever declared war on them had to perish or exterminate them.</p>
    <p>The chief sought their alliance; they evaded it, walled in their mistrust, unable to believe in the words or actions of beings, angered by benevolence and understanding no other flattery than terror. Faouhm, just as distrustful and ruthless, nonetheless had the qualities of a chief: they included indulgence for his followers, the need for praise, some form of narrow, rare, exclusive, tenacious sociability.</p>
    <p>He answered with brutal deference: "If the son of the Aurochs restores the Fire to the Oulhamr, he will take Gammla without ransom, he will be the second man of the tribe, to whom all the warriors will obey in the absence of the chief."</p>
    <p>Aghoo listened with a brutal air, turning his bushy face towards Gammla, he regarded her with covetousness; his round eyes hardened with menace. "The daughter of the Marsh will belong to the son of the Aurochs; any other man who lays his hand on her will be destroyed."</p>
    <p>These words irritated Naoh. Violently accepting the challenge, he exclaimed: "She will belong to the one who brings back the Fire!"</p>
    <p>"Aghoo will bring it back!"</p>
    <p>They stared at each other. Until this day, there had been no cause for conflict between them. Aware of their mutual strength, without common interests or immediate rivalry, they did not meet, they did not hunt together. Faouhm's speech had birthed hatred.</p>
    <p>Aghoo, who until yesterday hardly looked at Gammla as she passed, elusive, across the savannah, quivered in his flesh as Faouhm praised the girl. Built for sudden impulses, he wanted her as fiercely as if he had desired her for seasons. Henceforth, he condemned all rivals; he didn't even have a decision to make; his decision was in every fibre of his being.</p>
    <p>Naoh knew this. He secured his axe in his left hand and his spear in his right. At Aghoo's challenge, his brothers silently emerged, sly and formidable. They resembled him strangely, even more feral, with patches of red hair, eyes iridescent like beetle shells. Their agility was as unsettling as their strength.</p>
    <p>All three, ready to kill, watched Naoh. But a murmur arose among the warriors. Even those who criticized Naoh for the weakness of his hatreds did not want to see him perish after the destruction of so many Oulhamr and when he promised to bring back the Fire. He was known to be rich in stratagems, tireless, skilled in the art of maintaining the weakest flame and causing it to spring from the ashes: many believed in his luck.</p>
    <p>In truth, Aghoo also had the patience and cunning that make enterprises successful, and the Oulhamr understood the utility of a double attempt. They rose in turmoil; Naoh's supporters, buoyed by the clamour, prepared for battle.</p>
    <p>A stranger to fear, the son of the Aurochs did not scorn caution. He postponed the quarrel. Dry-Bones Goûn gathered the hazy thoughts of the crowd: "Do the Oulhamr wish to disappear from the world?"</p>
    <p>"Do they forget that enemies and waters have destroyed so many warriors? Out of four, only one remains! All those who can wield the axe, the spear, and the club must live."</p>
    <p>"Naoh and Aghoo are strong among the men who hunt in the forest and on the savannah: if one of them dies, the Oulhamr will be more weakened than if four others perished... The daughter of the Marsh will serve him who will return the Fire to us; the horde wishes it to be so."</p>
    <p>"Let it be so!" reinforced some rough voices.</p>
    <p>And the women, formidable in their number, in their almost untouched strength, in the unanimity of their sentiment, clamored: "Gammla will belong to the captor of the Fire!"</p>
    <p>Aghoo shrugged his hairy shoulders. He loathed the crowd but did not find it useful to defy them. Confident of outpacing Naoh, he reserved the right to confront his rival and make him disappear depending on the encounters. And his chest swelled with confidence.</p>
