    <h2><i>Chapter 2</i> The Mammoths and the Aurochs</h2>
    <p>It was at the next dawn. The wind from the highlands blew through the clouds, while close to the earth and the swamp, the air was heavy, torpid, fragrant and warm. The whole sky, vibrating like a lake, stirred up algae, water lilies, and pale reeds.</p>
    <p>Dawn rolled its foam there. It expanded, it overflowed into lagoons of sulfur, gulfs of beryl, rivers of pink pearl.</p>
    <p>The Oulhamr, facing this immense fire, felt something growing deep in their soul, something akin to a form of worship, which also swelled the small bagpipes of birds in the grass of the savannah and the osier beds of the swamp. But the wounded groaned from thirst; a dead warrior stretched out his blue limbs: a nocturnal beast had eaten his face.</p>
    <p>Goûn mumbled vague, almost rhythmic, complaints, and Faouhm had the corpse thrown into the waters.</p>
    <p>Then the tribe's attention turned to the Fire conquerors, Aghoo and Naoh, ready to depart. The hairy ones carried the club, the ax, the spear, the javelin with a flint or nephrite point. Naoh, relying on cunning rather than strength, preferred two agile young men capable of a long run over robust warriors. They each had an ax, a spear, and javelins. Naoh added an oak club, a branch barely roughened and hardened by fire. He preferred this weapon to any other and even opposed it to large carnivores.</p>
    <p>Faouhm first addressed the Aurochs:</p>
    <p>"Aghoo came to light before the son of the Leopard. He will choose his path. If he goes towards the Two Rivers, Naoh will circle the marshes, at the setting sun... and if he circles the marshes, Naoh will go towards the Two Rivers.</p>
    <p>Aghoo does not yet know his route!" protested the Hairy One. He seeks the Fire; he may go in the morning towards the river, in the evening towards the marsh. Does the hunter who follows the boar know where he will kill him?</p>
    <p>"Aghoo will change route later," Goûn intervened, supported by the murmurings of the horde. "He cannot simultaneously set out for the setting sun and for the Two Rivers. Let him choose!"</p>
    <p>In his dark soul, the son of the Aurochs understood that he would be wrong not to challenge the chief, but to awaken Naoh's distrust. He exclaimed, turning his wolfish gaze on the crowd:</p>
    <p>"Aghoo will depart towards the setting sun!"</p>
    <p>And, making a sudden sign to his brothers, he set off along the marsh.</p>
    <p>Naoh did not decide as quickly. He wanted to keep the image of Gammla in his eyes a little longer. She was standing under an ash tree, behind the group of the chief, Goûn and the elders. Naoh advanced; he saw her motionless, her face turned towards the savannah. She had put sagittarius flowers and a moon-colored water lily in her hair; a light seemed to emanate from her skin, brighter than that of the fresh rivers and the green flesh of the trees.</p>
    <p>Naoh breathed in the fervor of life, the anxious and unquenchable desire, the formidable vow that remakes beasts and plants. His heart swelled so much that it choked him, filled with tenderness and anger; all those who separated him from Gammla seemed as detestable as the sons of the Mammoth or the Man-Eaters.</p>
    <p>He raised his arm armed with the ax and said:</p>
    <p>"Swamp Daughter, Naoh will not return, he will disappear into the earth, the waters, the belly of hyenas, or he will return Fire to the Oulhamr. He will bring back to Gammla shells, blue stones, leopard teeth, and auroch horns."</p>
    <p>At these words, she looked at the warrior with the joy of children in her eyes. But Faouhm, shifting impatiently:</p>
    <p>"The sons of the Aurochs have disappeared behind the poplars."</p>
    <p>Then, Naoh headed south.</p>
    <p>Naoh, Gaw, and Nam walked all day on the savannah.</p>
    <p>It was still in its strength: the grasses followed the grasses like the waves follow each other on the sea. It bent under the breeze, cracked under the sun, scattered in space the innumerable soul of fragrances; it was threatening and fertile, monotonous in its mass, varied in its detail and produced as many beasts as flowers, as many eggs as seeds.</p>
    <p>Among the forests of grasses, the islands of broom, the peninsulas of heather, slipped the plantain, the St. John's wort, the sages, the buttercups, the yarrow, the campions, and the cress. Sometimes, the bare earth lived the slow life of the mineral, a primordial surface where the plant could not fix its tireless columns. Then reappeared mallow and wild roses, gôlantes or centaureas, red clover, or starry bushes.</p>
    <p>A hill would rise, a hollow would be dug; a pond stagnated, teeming with insects and reptiles; some erratic boulder raised its profile of mastodon; one could see antelopes, hares, saigas, wolves or dogs darting, bustards or partridges rising, pigeons, cranes and crows hovering; horses, hemiones, and elks galloped in herds. A gray bear, with gestures of a great ape and a rhinoceros, stronger than the tiger and almost as formidable as the giant lion, roamed the green earth; aurochs appeared on the horizon.</p>
    <p>Naoh, Nam, and Gaw camped in the evening at the foot of a mound; they had not crossed a tenth of the savannah, they could only see the breaking waves of grass. The earth was flat, uniform, and melancholic, all aspects of the world were made and unmade in the vast clouds of twilight. In front of their countless fires, Naoh thought about the small flame he was about to conquer. It seemed that he would only have to climb a hill, to extend a pine branch to seize a spark from the braziers that consumed the west.</p>
    <p>The clouds darkened. A purple abyss remained for a long time at the bottom of space, the little bright stones of the stars emerged one after another, the breath of the night blew.</p>
    <p>Naoh, accustomed to the vigil's pyre, a clear barrier placed in front of the sea of darkness, felt his weakness. The gray bear could appear, or the leopard, the tiger, the lion, although they rarely penetrated far into the savannah; a herd of aurochs would submerge the fragile human flesh under its waves; the numbers gave the wolves the power of the large predators, hunger armed them with courage.</p>
    <p>The warriors fed on raw meat. It was a sorrowful meal; they loved the aroma of roasted meats. Afterwards, Naoh took the first watch. His whole being absorbed the night. He was a marvelous form, into which penetrated the subtle things of the Universe: through his sight, he captured phosphorescences, pale forms, the shifts of the shadow, and he rose among the stars; through his hearing, he untangled the voices of the breeze, the cracking of the plants, the flight of insects and birds of prey, the steps and crawling of beasts; he distinguished in the distance the yelping of the jackal, the laugh of the hyena, the howling of the wolves, the cry of the osprey, the screeching of the locusts; through his nostrils penetrated the breath of the amorous flower, the cheerful scent of the grasses, the stench of the predators, the insipid or musky smell of reptiles. His skin shivered at a thousand subtle variations of cold and hot, of humidity and dryness, at all the nuances of the breeze. Thus he lived from what filled Space and Duration.</p>
    <p>This life was not gratuitous, but hard and full of threat. All that constructed it could destroy it; it would persist only through vigilance, strength, cunning, an unrelenting struggle against things.</p>
    <p>Naoh watched, in the darkness, for the fangs that cut, the claws that tear, the fiery eye of the flesh-eaters.</p>
    <p>Many discerned in men powerful beasts and did not linger. Hyenas passed by with jaws more terrible than those of lions: but they did not like battle and sought dead flesh. A troop of wolves passed by, and they lingered: they knew the power of numbers, they guessed themselves almost as strong as the Oulhamr.</p>
    <p>However, their hunger not being excessive, they followed the traces of antelopes. Dogs passed by, comparable to wolves; they howled for a long time around the mound. Sometimes they threatened, sometimes one or another approached with sly mannerisms. They did not readily attack the upright beast. In the past, they camped in numbers near the horde; they devoured the leftovers and mingled with the hunts. Goûn formed an alliance with two dogs to whom he would abandon entrails and bones. They perished in a fight against a boar; an alliance with the others became impossible, for Faouhm, having taken command, ordered a great massacre.</p>
    <p>This alliance attracted Naoh; he sensed a new force in it, more security and more power. But, in the savannah, alone with two warriors, he especially conceived its peril. He would have tried it with a few beasts, not with a herd.</p>
    <p>However, the dogs were tightening the circle; their cries were becoming rare, and their breaths quick. Naoh was moved. He took a handful of earth, he threw it at the boldest, shouting:</p>
    <p>"We have spears and clubs that can destroy the bear, the aurochs and the lion!…"</p>
    <p>The dog, struck in the mouth and surprised by the inflections of the speech, fled. The others called to each other and seemed to deliberate.</p>
    <p>Naoh threw another handful of earth:</p>
    <p>"You are too weak to fight the Oulhamr! Go seek the saigas and destroy the wolves. The dog that approaches again will spill its guts."</p>
    <p>Awakened by the voice of the chief, Nam and Gaw rose; these new silhouettes determined the retreat of the beasts.</p>
    <p>Naoh traveled for seven days, avoiding the traps of the world. They increased as they approached the forest. Although it was still several days away, it was announced by clusters of trees, by the appearance of large predators; the Oulhamr saw the tiger and the large panther.</p>
    <p>The nights became painful: they worked, long before twilight, to surround themselves with obstacles; they sought the hollows of the mounds, the rocks, the thickets; they fled the trees. On the eighth and ninth day, they suffered from thirst. The earth offered neither springs nor ponds; the desert of grasses was paling; dry reptiles glittered among the stones; the insects spread throughout the expanse a disquieting palpitation: they spun in spirals of copper, jade, mother-of-pearl; they descended on the warriors' skin and darted their acrid probosces.</p>
    <p>As the shadow of the ninth day lengthened, the earth became cool and tender, a scent of water descended from the hills, and a herd of aurochs was seen marching south.</p>
    <p>Then, Naoh said to his companions:</p>
    <p>"We will drink before sunset!... The aurochs are going to the watering hole."</p>
    <p>Nam, son of the Poplar, and Gaw, son of the Saiga, straightened their parched bodies. They were agile and uncertain men. They needed to be given courage, resignation, resistance to pain, confidence. In return, they offered their docility, pliable as clay, prone to enthusiasm, quick to forget suffering and savor joy. And because they, being alone, quickly lost their bearings in the face of the earth and beasts, they submitted to unity: thus, Naoh perceived in them extensions of his own energy. Their hands were skillful, their feet flexible, their eyes far-sighted, their ears sharp. A leader could draw reliable services from them; all they needed to know was his will and courage. Now, since their departure, their hearts had attached themselves to Naoh; he was the emanation of the race, the human power in the face of the cruel mystery of the Universe, the refuge that would shelter them while they threw the harpoon or brought down the axe. And sometimes, when he walked in front of them, in the intoxication of the morning, joyful in his stature and his great chest, they shuddered with a fierce and almost tender exaltation, all their instinct flourishing towards the leader, like the beech tree towards the light.</p>
    <p>He felt it more than he understood it, he grew with these beings tied to his fate, a more multiple, more complicated individuality, more certain to conquer and outwit the traps.</p>
    <p>Long shadows detached themselves from the base of the trees, the grasses swelled with abundant sap, and the sun, larger and yellower as it slipped towards the abyss, made the herd of aurochs shine like a river of tawny waters.</p>
    <p>Naoh's last doubts dissipated: beyond the notch of the hills, the watering hole was close; his instinct assured him of this, as did the number of furtive beasts following the path of the aurochs. Nam and Gaw also knew it, their nostrils dilated with the fresh emanations.</p>
    <p>"We must get ahead of the aurochs," Naoh said.</p>
    <p>For he feared that the watering hole might be narrow and that the colossi might obstruct its edges. The warriors quickened their pace in order to reach the hollow of the hills before the herd.</p>
    <p>Because of their number, the caution of the old bulls, and the weariness of the young, the beasts moved slowly.</p>
    <p>The Oulhamr gained ground. Other creatures were employing the same tactic; light saigas, egagres, mouflons, hemiones, and a troop of horses could be seen darting about, with several already crossing the pass. Naoh took a significant lead over the aurochs: they could drink leisurely.</p>
    <p>When the men reached the highest hill, the aurochs were a thousand cubits behind.</p>
    <p>Nam and Gaw still pressed the pace; their thirst was growing; they circled the hill, entered the pass. Water appeared, the creative mother, more beneficial than Fire itself and less cruel: it was almost a lake, spread out at the foot of a chain of rocks, dotted with peninsulas, fed on the right by the waves of a river, pouring into an abyss on the left. There were three ways to reach it: the river itself, the pass the Oulhamr had crossed, and another pass, between the rocks and one of the hills; everywhere else, basaltic walls grew.</p>
    <p>The warriors hailed the water. Oranged by the dying sun, it quenched the thirst of the thin saigas, the small stout horses, the onagers with fine hooves, the mouflons with bearded faces, a few roe deer more elusive than falling leaves, and an old elk whose forehead seemed to produce a tree. A brutal, quarrelsome, and morose wild boar was the only one who drank without fear. The others, with mobile ears and jumping eyes, with continual gestures of flight, revealed the law of life, the infinite alertness of the weak.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, all ears perked up, heads scrutinized the unknown. It was quick, certain, with a sense of chaos: horses, onagers, saigas, mouflons, roe deer, and elk fled through the western pass, under the downpour of scarlet rays. Only the wild boar remained, its little bloodshot eyes rotating among the bristles of the eyelids. And wolves appeared, of a large breed, forest wolves as much as savannah wolves, tall on their legs, with sturdy muzzles, close-set eyes, and yellow gazes that, instead of scattering like those of the herbivores, converged towards the prey. Naoh, Nam, and Gaw held their spears and javelins ready, while the wild boar raised its hooked tusks and snorted formidably. With their cunning eyes, their intelligent nostrils, the wolves sized up the enemy: deeming it formidable, they pursued the fleeing prey.</p>
    <p>Their departure created a great calm, and the Oulhamr, having finished drinking, deliberated. Twilight was near; the sun was sinking behind the rocks; it was too late to continue the journey: where should they choose to rest?</p>
    <p>"The aurochs are approaching!" Naoh said.</p>
    <p>He turned his head towards the western pass; the three warriors listened, then lay down on the ground.</p>
    <p>"Those coming are not aurochs!" Gaw murmured.</p>
    <p>And Naoh asserted:</p>
    <p>"They are mammoths!"</p>
    <p>They quickly surveyed the site: the river emerged between the basaltic hill and a wall of red porphyry where a projection wide enough to admit the passage of a large beast rose. The Oulhamr climbed it.</p>
    <p>At the pit of the stone, water flowed in eternal shadow and half-light; trees, felled by the landslide or torn by their own weight, sprawled horizontally over the abyss; others rose from the depth, thin and excessively long, all energy lost in hoisting a bouquet of leaves into the region of pale glimmers; and all, devoured by moss as thick as bear fur, strangled by vines, rotted by mushrooms, displayed the indestructible patience of the defeated.</p>
    <p>Nam was the first to spot a cave. Low and shallow, it dug in irregularly. The Oulhamr did not enter right away; they visually searched it for a long time. Finally, Naoh preceded his companions, lowering his head and flaring his nostrils: bones were found, with fragments of skin, horns, elk antlers, jaws. The host revealed itself to be a powerful and fearsome hunter; Naoh kept inhaling its emanations:</p>
    <p>"It's the cave of the gray bear...," he declared. "It has been empty for over a moon."</p>
    <p>Nam and Gaw did not know much about this formidable creature, the Oulhamr roaming regions haunted by the tiger, the lion, the aurochs, even the mammoth, but where the gray bear was rare.</p>
    <p>Naoh had encountered it during distant expeditions; he knew its ferocity, blind like that of the rhinoceros, its strength almost equal to that of the giant lion, its furious and inextinguishable courage. The cave was abandoned, either because the bear had given up on it, or because it had moved for a few weeks or a season, or even because it had come to grief crossing the river. Convinced that the beast would not return that night, Naoh decided to occupy its home. As he was declaring this to his companions, a vast noise vibrated along the rocks and the river: the aurochs had arrived! Their voices, as powerful as the roars of lions, crashed against all the echoes of the strange territory.</p>
    <p>Naoh did not listen to the noise of these colossal beasts without unease. For man hunted the urus and the aurochs but little. The bulls reached a size, a strength, an agility that their descendants would no longer know; their lungs filled with richer oxygen; their faculties were, if not more subtle, at least more vivid and lucid; they knew their rank, they feared the great predators only for the weak, the stragglers, or those who ventured alone into the savanna.</p>
    <p>The three Oulhamr came out of the cave. Their chests thrilled at the grand spectacle; their hearts knew its wild splendor; their obscure mentality seized, without verb, without thought, the energetic beauty that thrilled at the bottom of their own being; they sensed the tragic turmoil from which, after the centuries of centuries, the poetry of the great barbarians would emerge.</p>
    <p>Hardly had they emerged from the half-light when another clamor arose, piercing the first as an axe cleaves the flesh of a goat. It was a membranous cry, less deep, less rhythmic, weaker than the cry of the aurochs; yet, it announced the strongest of creatures roaming the face of the earth. At that time, the mammoth moved invincibly. Its stature kept the lion and tiger at bay; it discouraged the gray bear; man would not pit himself against it for millennia, and only the rhinoceros, blind and stupid, dared to fight it. It was flexible, fast, tireless, capable of climbing mountains, thoughtful with a tenacious memory; it grasped, worked, and measured matter with its trunk, dug the earth with its enormous tusks, led its expeditions wisely and knew its supremacy: life was beautiful for it; its blood ran very red; there is no doubt that its consciousness was more lucid, its sense of things more subtle than it is in elephants debased by the long victory of man.</p>
    <p>It happened that the leaders of the aurochs and those of the mammoths approached the edge of the waters at the same time. The mammoths, according to their rule, claimed to pass first; this rule encountered no opposition either from the urus or from the aurochs. However, some aurochs became irritated, accustomed to seeing other herbivores yield and led by bulls who were unfamiliar with the mammoth.</p>
    <p>Now, the eight leading bulls were gigantic - the largest equaled the volume of a rhinoceros; their patience was short, their thirst intense. Seeing that the mammoths wanted to go first, they let out their long war cry, snout high, throat swollen like a bagpipe.</p>
    <p>The mammoths trumpeted. There were five old males: their bodies were like mounds and their feet like trees; they displayed tusks of ten cubits, capable of piercing oaks; their trunks looked like black pythons; their heads, like rocks; they moved in skin thick as the bark of old elms. Behind them followed the long clay-colored herd...</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, their agile little eyes fixed on the bulls, the old mammoths blocked the path, peaceful, imperturbable, and contemplative. The eight aurochs, with heavy eyes, mounded backs, wooly and bearded heads, and diverging, arching horns, shook their greasy, heavy, muddy manes: deep in their instinct, they perceived the power of the enemies, but the roars of the herd bathed them in a warlike vibration. The strongest, the chief of chiefs, lowered his dense forehead, his glittering horns; he launched himself like a vast projectile, he rebounded against the nearest mammoth. Struck on the shoulder and although he had dampened the blow with a whip of his trunk, the colossus fell to his knees. The auroch pursued the battle with the tenacity of his race. He had the advantage; his sharp horn redoubled the attack, and the mammoth could only use his trunk, very imperfectly. In this vast melee of muscles, the auroch was reckless fury, a storm of instincts revealed by the large misty eyes, the throbbing nape, the foamy snout and the sure, sharp, swift, but monotonous movements. If he could bring down the adversary and open his belly, where the skin was thinner and the flesh more sensitive, he would have to win.</p>
    <p>The mammoth was aware of this; he endeavored to avoid a complete fall, and the danger induced him to be cool-headed. A single surge was enough to lift him, but the auroch would have had to slow his pushes.</p>
    <p>At first, the fight had taken the other males by surprise. The four mammoths and the seven bulls stood face to face in a formidable wait. None made a move to intervene: they themselves felt threatened. The mammoths were the first to show signs of impatience. The tallest one, with a huff, fluttered his membranous ears, like gigantic bats, and advanced. Almost at the same time, the one battling the bull directed a violent trunk swing at the legs of his adversary. The auroch staggered in turn and the mammoth straightened up. The enormous beasts found themselves face to face. Fury swirled in the skull of the mammoth; he raised his trunk with a metallic bellow and led the attack. The curved tusks thrust the auroch and cracked the bone structure; then, veering, the mammoth flung down his trunk. With growing rage, he burst open the adversary's belly, trampled the long entrails and broken ribs, his monstrous legs bathed in blood up to the chest. The dreadful agony was lost in a roll of clamors: the battle between the great males had begun. The seven aurochs, the four mammoths charged into a blind battle, comparable to panics where the beast loses all control over itself. Vertigo seized the herds; the deep bellowing of the aurochs clashed with the shrill trumpeting of the mammoths; hatred stirred these long waves of bodies, these torrents of heads, horns, tusks, and trunks.</p>
    <p>The male leaders lived only for war: their structures mingled in an amorphous squirming, a vast crush of flesh, kneaded with pain and rage. At the first clash, the inferiority in numbers had given the mammoths a disadvantage. One of them was knocked down by three bulls, a second immobilized in defense; but the other two won a swift victory. Thrown en masse upon their antagonists, they had pierced, suffocated, dislocated them; they spent more time trampling the victims than they had in defeating them. Finally, perceiving the peril of their companions, they charged: the three aurochs, hell-bent on destroying the toppled colossus, were taken by surprise. They tumbled in a single mass; two were crushed under the heavy paws, the third slipped away. His flight triggered that of the still-fighting bulls, and the aurochs knew the immense contagion of terror. First a stormy unease, a silence, a strange stillness that seemed to spread through the multitude, then the wavering of vague eyes, a trampling like the fall of rain, a rush, a flight that became a battle in the pass that was too narrow, each beast transformed into fleeing energy, a panic projectile, the strong toppling the weak, the swift fleeing on the backs of others, while the bones cracked like trees felled by a cyclone.</p>
    <p>The mammoths had no thought of pursuit: once again they had demonstrated their power, once again they knew themselves as the masters of the earth; and the column of clay-colored giants, with their long coarse hair, rough manes, lined up on the bank of the watering hole and began to drink in such a formidable manner that the water lowered in the creeks.</p>
    <p>On the flank of the hills, a stream of light beasts, still startled by the struggle, watched the mammoths drink. The Oulhamr watched them too, in awe of one of nature's grand episodes. And Naoh, comparing the sovereign beasts to Nam and Gaw, their slender arms, thin legs, narrow torsos, their feet as rough as oaks, bodies tall as rocks, perceived the smallness and fragility of man, the humble wandering life he led on the face of the savannahs.</p>
    <p>He also thought of the yellow lions, the giant lions and the tigers he would encounter in the nearby forest, under whose claws man or the deer are as weak as a dove in the claws of an eagle.</p>
