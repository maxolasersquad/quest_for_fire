    <h2><i>Chapter 5</i> Under the Boulders</h2>
    <p>When morning wandered over the earth, the giant lion and the tigress were still there. They dozed beside the carcass of the deer, in a pale ray of sunlight. And the three men, buried under the stone refuge, could not take their eyes off the formidable neighbors. A cheerful gaiety descended upon the forest, the savannah, and the river. The herons were leading their young to fish; a flash of mother-of-pearl preceded the diving of the grebes; in all the turns of grass and branch, fledglings lurked. A sudden shimmer signaled the kingfisher; the jay flaunted its blue, silver, and russet plumage, and sometimes the mocking magpie, chattering on a fork, waved its tail from which seemed to alternately burst shadow and light. However, rooks and crows croaked over the skeletons of the hémione and the tiger: disappointed in front of these bones where no sinew remained, they departed, in oblique flights, toward the remains of the deer. There, two thick ashy vultures blocked the way. These beasts with bald necks, with eyes of swampy water, did not dare touch the prey of the felines. They circled, they sidled, they thrust their beak into the stinking nostrils and withdrew it, with a stupid waddle or sudden flight. Then, motionless, they seemed lost in a dream, abruptly broken by a start of the head. Apart from the mobile redness of a squirrel immediately drowned in the leaves, no mammals were seen: the scent of the great felines kept them in the shadows or hidden in safe shelters.</p>
    <p>Naoh believed that the memory of spear blows had brought back the giant lion; he regretted this futile action. For Oulhamr did not doubt that the beasts would understand each other and thus each would take turns watching near the refuge. Stories rolled through his brain where the grudge and persistence of beasts offended by man erupted. Sometimes fury swelled his chest; he rose, brandishing his club or his axe. This anger quickly subsided: despite his victory over the gray bear, he considered man inferior to the great carnivores. The cunning that had succeeded in the dimness of the cave would not succeed with the giant lion nor with the tigress.</p>
    <p>However, he did not foresee any end other than combat: one must either starve under the stones or take advantage of the moment when the tigress would be alone. Could he fully count on Nam and Gaw?</p>
    <p>He shook himself, as if he were cold; he saw the eyes of his companions fixed on him. His strength felt the need to reassure them:</p>
    <p>"Nam and Gaw have escaped the teeth of the bear: they will escape the claws of the giant lion!"</p>
    <p>The young Oulhamr turned their faces towards the terrifying sleeping couple.</p>
    <p>Naoh answered their thoughts:</p>
    <p>"The Giant Lion and the Tigress will not always be together. Hunger will separate them. When the lion is in the forest, we will fight, but Nam and Gaw must obey my command."</p>
    <p>The chief's words inflated the flesh of the young men with hope; and even destruction, if they fought with Naoh, seemed less formidable.</p>
    <p>The son of the Poplar, quicker to speak, cried out:</p>
    <p>"Nam will obey to the death!"</p>
    <p>The other raised both arms:</p>
    <p>"Gaw fears nothing with Naoh."</p>
    <p>The chief looked at them with gentleness; it was as if the energy of the world descended into their chests, with countless sensations, none of which found words to express themselves, and, uttering the war cry, Nam and Gaw brandished their axes.</p>
    <p>At the noise, the felines jumped; the nomads howled louder, in a sign of defiance; the beasts exhaled roars of anger... All fell back into calm. The light turned on the forest; the sleep of the felines reassured the agile beasts who, stealthily, passed along the river; the vultures, at long intervals, snatched a few shreds of flesh; the corolla of flowers raised towards the sun; life exhaled so tenacious and so numerous that it seemed about to take hold of the firmament.</p>
    <p>The three men waited, with the same patience as the beasts. Nam and Gaw fell asleep at intervals. Naoh resumed plans that were fleeing and monotonous like those of mammoths, wolves, or dogs. They still had meat for one meal, but thirst was beginning to torment them: however, it would not become intolerable until after several days.</p>
    <p>Toward twilight, the giant lion stood up. Darting a fiery glance at the erratic blocks, he assured himself of the presence of enemies. No doubt he had no exact memory of the events, but his instinct for vengeance rekindled and was sustained by the scent of Oulhamr; he snorted with anger and made his round in front of the crevices of the refuge. Finally remembering that the stronghold was unapproachable and that claws sprang from it, he ceased to</p>
    <p>prowl and stopped near the carcass of the deer, of which the vultures had taken little. The tigress was already there. They took little time to devour the remains, then the great lion turned towards the tigress his reddish skull. Something tender emanated from the fierce beast, to which the tigress responded with a meow, her long body couched in the grass. The lion-tiger, rubbing his muzzle against the back of his companion, licked her with a rough and flexible tongue. She yielded to the caress, eyes half-closed, full of green glimmers; then she leaped backward, her attitude became almost threatening. The male growled</p>
    <p>– a muffled and caressing growl – while the tigress played in the twilight. The orange glimmers gave her the appearance of some dancing flame</p>
    <p>; she flattened like an</p>
    <p>immense serpent, crawled in the grass and hid there, leaped away in huge bounds.</p>
    <p>Her companion, at first motionless, stiffened on his blackish legs, his eyes reddened by the sun, rushed towards her. She fled, she slipped into a cluster of ash trees, where he followed her, crawling.</p>
    <p>And Nam, having seen the beasts disappear, said:</p>
    <p>"They are gone... We must cross the river."</p>
    <p>"Has Nam no more ears and no more scent?" replied Naoh. "Or does he think he can leap faster than the giant lion?"</p>
    <p>Nam lowered his head: a cavernous breath rose among the ash trees, giving the chief's words an imperative meaning. The warrior recognized that the danger was as close as when the carnivores were sleeping in front of the basaltic blocks.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, some hope remained in the heart of Oulhamr: the lion-tiger and the tigress, through their very union,</p>
    <p>would feel an increased need for a lair. For the great beasts rarely lie on bare ground, especially in the season of rains.</p>
    <p>When the three men saw the sun's blaze descending into darkness, they felt the same secret anguish that, in the vast land of trees and grasses, stirs the herbivores. It grew as their enemies reappeared. The giant lion's gait was grave, almost heavy; the tigress circled around him with tremendous gaiety. They returned to sniff the presence of men just as the red star crumbled, and a vast shiver, hungry voices, rose over the plain: the monstrous mouths passed and re-passed before the Oulhamr, eyes of green fire danced like glimmers over a marsh. Finally, the lion-tiger crouched, while his mate slipped into the grasses and went hunting for beasts among the river's bushes.</p>
    <p>Large stars lit up in the waters of the firmament. Then the whole expanse quivered entirely with these small unchanging fires, and the archipelago of the Milky Way revealed its bays, straits, and bright islands.</p>
    <p>Gaw and Nam hardly looked at the stars, but Naoh was not insensitive to them. His confused soul drew from them a keener sense of night, of darkness, and of space. He believed that most appeared only like sparks of a blaze, varying each night, but a few returned persistently. The inactivity in which he had lived since the previous day reviving some lost energy in him, he dreamed before the black mass of vegetation and the fine gleams of the sky. And in his heart, something exalted, which bound him more tightly to the earth.</p>
    <p>The moon slid through the branches. It illuminated the giant lion crouching among the tall grass and the tigress, who, roaming from the savannah to the forest, sought to drive some animal towards him. This maneuver worried the chief.</p>
    <p>However, the tigress finally advanced so much under cover that one might have fought her mate. If the strength of Nam and Gaw had been equal to his, Naoh might have risked the adventure. He was tormented by thirst. Nam suffered from it more: though it was not his turn to watch, he could not sleep. The young Oulhamr opened feverish eyes in the twilight; Naoh himself was sad. He had never felt the distance that separated him from the horde, from that small island of beings, outside of which he was lost in cruel immensity, so long. The faces of women floated around him like a force more gifted, more sure, more lasting than that of males...</p>
    <p>In his dream, he fell into that sleep of watchfulness that the lightest approach dispels. Time passed under the stars.</p>
    <p>Naoh only awoke at the return of the tigress. She brought back no prey; she seemed tired. The lion-tiger, having risen, sniffed her at length and went hunting in turn. He too followed the edge of the river, lurked in the bushes, extended his run into the forest. Naoh watched him eagerly. Often, he nearly awakened the others (Nam had succumbed to sleep), but a sure instinct warned him that the brute was not yet far enough away. Finally, he decided; he touched the shoulders of his companions, and when they stood up, he murmured:</p>
    <p>"Are Nam and Gaw ready to fight?"</p>
    <p>They answered:</p>
    <p>"The son of Saïga will follow Naoh!"</p>
    <p>"Nam will fight with the spear and the harpoon."</p>
    <p>The young warriors regarded the tigress. Although the beast was still lying down, she was not asleep: at some distance, her back turned to the basalt blocks, she was watching. Now Naoh, during his watch, had silently cleared the exit.</p>
    <p>If the tigress's attention were aroused at once, only one man, or two at the most, would have time to emerge from the refuge.</p>
    <p>Having ensured that the weapons were ready, Naoh began by pushing his harpoon and club outside, then he slid out with infinite caution. Luck favored him</p>
    <p>:</p>
    <p>howls of wolves, hoots of owls covered the light noise of the body brushing against the earth. Naoh found himself on the meadow, and already Gaw's head was coming to the opening. The young warrior came out with a sudden movement</p>
    <p>; the tigress turned and stared</p>
    <p>intently at the nomads. Surprised, she did not attack right away, so Nam was able to join them. Only then did the tigress leap, with a mewling call; then she continued to approach the men, unhurriedly, certain they could not escape. They, however, had raised their spears.</p>
    <p>Nam was to throw his first, then Gaw, and both would aim for the legs. The son of the Poplar took advantage of a favorable moment. The weapon whizzed; it struck too high, near the shoulder. Whether the distance was too great or the point had slid askew, the tigress seemed to feel no pain: she growled and hastened her pace. Gaw, in turn, threw the spear. He missed the beast, which had dodged. It was Naoh's turn.</p>
    <p>Stronger than his companions, he could inflict a deep wound. He threw the spear when the tigress was only twenty cubits away; he hit her in the neck. This injury did not stop her, and she hastened her charge.</p>
    <p>She arrived upon the three men like a solid mass: Gaw fell, struck by a claw swipe to the chest. But Naoh's heavy club had struck; the tigress was howling, a leg broken, while the son of the Poplar attacked with his spear. She writhed with prodigious speed, flattened Nam to the ground, and rose on her hind legs to seize Naoh.</p>
    <p>The monstrous maw was upon him, a hot and fetid breath; a claw tore him... The club struck again. Screaming in pain, the beast had a dizzy spell that allowed the nomad to escape and break a second leg. The tigress spun on herself, seeking a balanced position, snapping at the air, while the club kept pounding on her limbs. The beast fell, and Naoh could have finished her off, but his companions' injuries concerned him. He found Gaw standing, his chest red from the blood that spurted from his chest: three long gashes marked the flesh. As for Nam, he lay dazed, with wounds that seemed slight; a deep pain spread through his chest and loins; he could not get up. To Naoh's questions, he responded as a man half asleep.</p>
    <p>Then the chief asked:</p>
    <p>"Can Gaw make it to the river?"</p>
    <p>"Gaw will go to the river," murmured the young Oulhamr.</p>
    <p>Naoh lay down and pressed his ear against the earth, then he breathed in the space around him deeply. Nothing revealed the approach of the giant lion, and, as after the fever of the battle, the thirst became unbearable, the chief picked up Nam in his arms and carried him to the water's edge. There, he helped Gaw to quench his thirst, drank himself abundantly, and gave Nam water by pouring it from the palm of his hand into his mouth. Then he returned to the basaltic blocks, with Nam against his chest and supporting Gaw, who was stumbling.</p>
    <p>The Oulhamrs knew little about treating wounds: they covered them with some leaves that an instinct, more animal than human, made them choose for their aromatic properties. Naoh went out again to fetch some willow and mint leaves which he applied, after crushing them, to Gaw's chest. The blood flowed</p>
    <p>more weakly, and nothing indicated that the wounds were fatal. Nam was coming out of his stupor, although his limbs, his legs especially, remained inert. And Naoh did not forget the comforting words:</p>
    <p>"Nam and Gaw have fought well... The sons of Oulhamr will proclaim their courage..."</p>
    <p>The young men's cheeks lit up with joy at seeing, once again, their victorious leader.</p>
    <p>"Naoh has slain the tigress," murmured the son of Saïga in a hollow voice, "as he had slain the gray bear!</p>
    <p>– There is no warrior as strong as Naoh!" groaned Nam.</p>
    <p>Then, the son of the Leopard repeated the words of hope with such force that the wounded felt the sweetness of the future:</p>
    <p>"We will bring back the Fire!"</p>
    <p>And he added:</p>
    <p>"The giant lion is still far away... Naoh will go for the prey."</p>
    <p>Naoh went to and fro across the plain, especially near the river. Sometimes he stopped in front of the tigress. She was alive.</p>
    <p>Under the bleeding flesh, her eyes shone, untouched: she was watching the great nomad moving around her. The wounds on her side and back were light, but the legs would not heal for a long time.</p>
    <p>Naoh stopped beside the defeated; as he attributed to her feelings similar to those of a man, he shouted:</p>
    <p>"Naoh has broken the legs of the tigress!... He has made her weaker than a she-wolf!"</p>
    <p>As the warrior approached, she rose with a rasping sound of anger and fear. He raised his club:</p>
    <p>"Naoh can kill the tigress, and the tigress cannot raise a single one of her claws against Naoh!"</p>
    <p>A confused noise was heard. Naoh crawled through the tall grass.</p>
    <p>And some does appeared, fleeing from dogs still unseen, whose barking could be heard. They leaped into the water after sniffing the scent of the tigress and the man, but Naoh's dart whizzed; one of the does, struck in the flank, drifted. In a few strokes, he reached her. Having finished her off with a blow from his club, he loaded her onto his shoulder and carried her to the refuge at a fast trot, for he sensed the near danger... As he slipped among the stones, the giant lion emerged from the forest.</p>
